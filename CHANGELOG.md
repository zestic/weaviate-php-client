## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **ðŸ”§ Tenant exists() and getByName() Methods**: Fixed critical bug where these methods returned false/null even after successful tenant creation
- **HTTP HEAD Request Handling**: Improved HttpConnection::head() method to properly distinguish between "not found" (404) and actual errors (network, auth, etc.)
- **Exception Handling**: Enhanced error handling in tenant operations to properly propagate network and authentication errors instead of masking them
- **Retry Support**: Added retry mechanism support for tenant existence checks and retrieval operations
- **Documentation**: Updated method documentation to clearly specify which exceptions can be thrown

### Enhanced
- **Error Differentiation**: Tenant methods now properly distinguish between "tenant doesn't exist" and actual system errors
- **Performance**: Tenant exists() method now uses efficient HEAD requests with proper error handling
- **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive tests for tenant error handling scenarios

## [0.4.0] - 2025-01-30

### Added
- **ðŸŽ¯ Comprehensive Query System**: Complete implementation matching Python client v4 API patterns
- **Filter System**: Full filtering capabilities with `Filter::byProperty()` and `Filter::byId()`

- **Complex Filters**: Support for nested combinations with `Filter::allOf()` and `Filter::anyOf()`
- **QueryBuilder**: Fluent interface for building GraphQL queries with filtering, limits, and property selection
- **Data Operations**: Enhanced with `fetchObjects()`, `findBy()`, and `findOneBy()` convenience methods
- **Query Exception Handling**: Dedicated `QueryException` class with detailed GraphQL error information
- **Configurable Default Fields**: Collection-specific default query fields with per-query overrides
- **Multi-tenant Query Support**: All query operations respect tenant context and isolation
